Tachiyomi

- Tachiyomi database containing library information

- Encrypt and upload it to cloud
   - Google API gives us a lot of legroom

- Download it to other devices

- Checksums compare library state

- It's easy to tell when there are changes

- Detect active and inactive reading, and only changes when the app is inactive

- Immediate changes: Items added or removed from libary

- Manual change alternative options
  - Multiple settings for when to autosync

- Pre-close cleanups:

   - Identify if it's possible to interrupt a shutdown to cleanup.

INVESTIGATE: Tachiyomi enhanced sync

Multimedia readers: Could connect to databases like MAL and correspond adaptations of the manga you're reading

Potential users: 16.6% of tachiyomi userbase. 500k?

PRIORITY: Figure out how the library backup is stored and changes, that's an already existing infrastrucure that can be used to simplify the sync.
